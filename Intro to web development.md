# What is a Website?

A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked **web pages** that share a single **domain name**. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business, or organization to serve a variety of purposes. A website is also known as a “web presence” or simply “site.”

Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the **World Wide Web** (WWW). The Web is a vast network of interconnected websites shared over the Internet.

### Why You Need a Website

Essentially, anyone looking to establish an online presence, share information, or engage with a community can benefit from having a website.

In today’s **digital** age, a simple static website can act as a business card, and a dynamic website can take the place of a storefront. They both allow you to share information with a global audience 24/7.

### Types of Websites

Websites can be either static or dynamic. Static websites function similarly to a printed brochure. Their content is pre-written and remains constant unless manually edited by an editor or the website owner.

In contrast, the content of a dynamic website is stored in databases, and web pages are generated on-the-fly by server-side scripts like PHP or Python.

### Components of a Website

Website design, content, navigation, and functionality components all contribute to a website’s overall success.

- Navigation components include a main menu, **breadcrumb** trails, andan optional **search bar**.
- **Web design** components include layout, color scheme, and **typography**.
- Content components include static content within a website page’s body, as well as dynamic content that can be displayed both around and within the body.
- Functionality components include forms, buttons, sliders, and interactive media.

### Website Benefits

Websites are powerful tools for individuals, businesses, and governments to establish an online presence and connect with a global audience. They can be used to connect users with similar interests, share information, provide entertainment, and sell products or services.

# What is web development?

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites, web applications, and other online platforms. It encompasses various aspects, including:
 
1. **Front-end Development (Client-side)**

- Focuses on user interface and user experience (UI/UX)
- Deals with client-side scripting languages (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Responsible for layout, design, and interactivity
- Involves frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js

2. **Back-end Development (Server-side)**

- Focuses on server-side logic, database integration, and API connectivity
- Deals with server-side programming languages (Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js)
- Responsible for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation
- Involves frameworks and libraries like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails

3. **Full-stack Development**

- Combines front-end and back-end development skills
- Involves working on both client-side and server-side development
- Requires knowledge of databases, APIs, and version control systems
- Full-stack developers can handle entire web application development

Additionally, some sources may group web development into more specific categories:

### Sub-categories:

- **Database Development:** Focuses on designing, implementing, and managing databases.
- **API Development:** Concentrates on building RESTful APIs for data exchange.
- **DevOps:** Emphasizes ensuring smooth deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of web applications.
- **Web Security:** Specializes in protecting web applications from vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Web Design:** Focuses on visual design, user experience, and user interface.
